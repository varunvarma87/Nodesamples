### v1.0.2

* Remove child process support (https://github.paypal.com/NodeInfra/node-ppcryptutils/issues/17).

### v1.0.1

* Adding support for AES128 and SHA256.
* Child process crypto support - currently behind flag.

### v1.0.0

Major refactor with breaking changes.

* Refactored and simplified code.
* Renamed to `cryptutils-paypal` as per module naming conventions.

Breaking changes:

* `new` keyword is no longer used to create a crypto utility instance. Instead the factory function is called.
* Creating a crypto utility object always requires `encryptionKey` and `macKey` since instance functions perform both crypto and hmac.
* `createCipherSpec` arguments have changed. Requires `encryptionAlgorithm` and `encryptionKey` to be passed. Now accessed statically.
* `createHmac` arguments have changed. Requires `macAlgorithm` and `macKey` to be passed. Now accessed statically.
* `hmacString` arguments have changed. Requires `macAlgorithm` and `macKey` to be passed. Now accessed statically.
* Base64 encoded has been removed entirely to its own module [base64-paypal](https://github.paypal.com/NodeInfra/base64-paypal).

### v0.1.0

* Greatly improved performance speed of base64.

### v0.0.5

* Simplifying CipherSpecs to use default object CipherSpec unless some custom key formatting, etc, is needed.
* Deleted many CipherSpec implementations as per above note.
* Added aes-256-cbc info.
