It collects data about certain usage metrics of a website such as hit counts, abandonment rates, and usage patterns, correlated with some PayPal-specific information about the users.\n\nThe SiteCatalyst component will add JavaScript to the page as well as include an external JavaScript file that is owned by the analytics team.  The external JavaScript file is referenced from the paypalobjects pool of servers.\n\nIf you are using one of the layout files, this component is already included.\n\n| Attributes                    | Expected Values    | Description            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                                                           |\n| -----------------             |:------------------\t| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------\t                                                  |\n| disableOnLoad\t                | --     \t\t          | Disable attaching onload event so that pages with Ajax response will have more control| \n\n## Prerequisite\n   * CoreComponents are distributed through Bower.
