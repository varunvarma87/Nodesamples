instance-detect-inc
===================

Module that determines the cluster instance id number the caller is running under.
This is generally of interest in determining the instanceId value to be used when
reporting metrics to Sherlock. 

# Installation

```
npm install instance-detect-inc --save
```

# Usage

```
var getId = require('instance-detect-inc').getInstanceId;
var id = getId();
```

If you are not running clustered, you will get a value of 1.
If you are running clustered, the value will be a small integer
in the range 1-n, where n is the number of clustered instances.
