### v1.0.0

** Requirements **

**Configuration**

* Global configuration should be assigned as a JSON object to `servicecore.configuration`.
* Global configuration should contain `servicecore` configuration and any client configurations.
* New config property `transport` tell `servicecore` which transport to use.
* Config property `host` is now `hostname`.
* Config property `path` is now `basepath`. `path` is used in `transport` options.

**Runtime**

* `servicecore` is also middleware now and sets up request context in `continuation-local-storage` for profiling, etc.
* `transport` is invoked via the injected first argument of every client function.
* Clients/wrappers no longer inherit, they are simply factories that return generic objects.

**Misc**

* `profile(req)` is removed from clients. This is handled automatically as part of the `continuation-local-storage` context.
* CAL log transaction names are now `module_function` as options to `path`; for example: `userread_load_by_account`.
* Set `NODE_DEBUG=servicecore` environment variable to enable `debuglog` output.
* Client-info and server-info are passed on headers as `x-pp-clientinfo` and `x-pp-serverinfo` by default. Asf transport passes in payload.
