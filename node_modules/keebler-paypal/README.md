# Keebler

Cookie Service integration for Node.js / Express.

Keebler provides express middleware for intercepting inbound and outbound cookies and delivering them to the Cookie Service for
processing.

# DEV NOTES

This module consists of two pieces:

1. a ```servicecore``` wrapper implementation that talks to the cookie service and
2. *middleware* which uses this wrapper.

The middleware part of this module does two things:

1. send cookies from browser to the ```/checkin``` service, replacing ```req.cookies``` with response.
2. sends cookies being set to ```/checkout``` service, replacing ```set-cookies``` with response.

# Usage

### Note: you MUST use ```express.cookieParser()``` to work with this middleware.

```javascript
var keebler = require("keebler");

app.use(express.cookieParser());

app.use(keebler());
```

You're done.
