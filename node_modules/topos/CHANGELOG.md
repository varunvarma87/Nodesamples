# CHANGELOG

## v0.3.2

- Separate out the connection tester functionality from the topo init, so that the connection testing can be done after the final confit object merge. Also connection testing can be utilised for ther environment as well.

## v0.3.1

### Bufix
Scan all the directories at the application root level to accomodate the use case of peer dependencies being placed at the same level as that of the application.

## v0.3.0

- Support for an application level `layout.json` file.

Now on, you can add a `layout.json` file at the application root to specify end points for services used directly at the application level (If there is no dedicated client/wrapper node module).

- Capability to override the Mid-tier service end points on staging environment using `staging.json`.

Oh wait, is it not possible now?. Nope. The aggregated `layout.json` overrides the `confit` values, and the staging.json service end point overrides are simply ignored.

So this version fixes the problem and allows staging env service end point overrides; how it should have been supposed to work.

However the fix is done specific to environments other than `production` and `sandbox` because providing an option to override end points for `production` and `sandbox` is inviting lots of trouble. This means the service end points cannot be overriden using `production.json` and `sandbox.json`. For production env the source of truth remains to be always `layout.json`.

- Dev dependencies will not be considered while aggregating the `layout.json`. The layout aggregation should have been done this way from day one.
