device-detection-paypal
===================

A server side utility (written as express middleware) to detect information of the client device based on the userAgent header of incoming request.

### Usage

```javascript
	npm install device-detection-paypal
```

#### As Middleware

To use Device detection as a Middleware add the following line:

```javascript
	app.use(require('device-detection-paypal').middleware());
```

Note that the above installation and use is typically handled for you in a Unified Node.js
application by the config/middleware.json file.


This middleware will set the `Device Info` to the request Object. 

```javascript
	console.log(req.deviceInfo);
```

#### As a module

To use the device detection module, pass the user-agent string as input.
```javascript
	require('device-detection-paypal').getDeviceInfo("your user agent", function (error, response){
		console.log(response);
	});
```

### Fallback 

if the Device detection service API endpoint fails, this module uses the (express-useragent) [https://github.com/biggora/express-useragent] parser module to find out basic properties.

To distinguish the Response from fallback - the property "fallback" will be set to true.

Following are the properties set by the fallback

`isTouchScreen` , `isTV`, `isTablet`, `isMobile`, `isRobot`, `osName`, `browserVersion`, `isDesktop`, `browser` and `fallback`
